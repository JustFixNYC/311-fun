This is a repository for playing around with the new NYC 311 API.

## Quick start

You will need Node JS.

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

Now edit `.env` as needed.

Then run:

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

This will start a program that eternally converts your
TypeScript code to JS.

Now in a separate terminal, run:

```
node 311-fun.js
```

It doesn't do much yet.
